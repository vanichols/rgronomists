You can get easy access to weather data the is available on the [Iowa
Mesonetâ€™s NWS Cooperative Network
Page](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/COOP/)

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00
